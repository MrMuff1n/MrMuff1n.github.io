Variables-THE BANE OF EXISTENCE

20.9.16

I started off this lesson with some basic skills, such as what you require for your code to work (eg. No typos, we learnt that the hard way, we kept on making one mistake and then having to restart! Aaaaaaarggh). At the end of last lesson however, we got to the end of the first section in the booklet. THe new section was titled variables, with me and my partner's combined knowledge of coding, we realised that these were 'the bits code that changes, like lifes and, umm, chocolate bar countâ€¦.'. To be honest, we didn't know much about variables, but, our target for the end of the lesson was to understand them better and be able to use them to some degree. I think we, through blood, sweat and tears, achieved this target and are quite accomplished with them.

In the lesson, we discovered that the strategy we used last week for our learning still worked, and we almost finished the variables section in the lesson. Sadly, however, we also learnt that variables were the

BANE OF EXISTENCE. This is because whenever youre doing variables, and you want to do, say, amount of children (5)-the amount of muffins(7), you would have to go out of the editor, onto the basic script (as in, the really basic script-the one which you have to click F2 to open up the editor) and then write in something like:

Muffins=7

Children=5

Then go back to the editor and then whenever you write muffins they are 7. At first it was really confusing because we didn't have any idea whatsoever of what was going on and even when we understood, we still think that they are evil.
