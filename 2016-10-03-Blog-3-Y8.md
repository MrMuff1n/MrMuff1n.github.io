Not much

27.9.16

This blog is called not much because, well, not much happened in the lesson. Our plan was to redo everything we did so far and record it in some way, but, there was nothing to record it with, as we sadly realised when about to put all of our freshly made files into a safe container (like a memory stick or something). So basically, this lesson was lesson 1 and 2 without all of the struggles of not understanding put together. At least it was a good refresher, though next lesson, I plan to bring in a memory stick (I hope).

Sorry about the length, there wasn't much to write about
