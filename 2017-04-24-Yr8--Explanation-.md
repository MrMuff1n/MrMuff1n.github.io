So, I know you are asking, 'What happened to all the others blogs?!',

Here you go then: When I was checking my blog on the last day of the holidays to see how it looked, I realised how terrible it was and how I'dâ€™ve done a much better job if i had done it now and that all they were was me explaining how my computer was broken and how long it took to fix it (nothing I could learn from). Sooo, I ended up deleting my blogs.

I hope this fresh start will be for the better.
