Latest Blog.   14.6.16

In this lesson, we began work on our own microbit game, however, we started by filling out an anonymous form about yourselves, your devices and your family. After that, I set to work on my new game, punchbag! I mainly worked on getting the start right but had some trouble making the instructions go across the screen faster. I then moved on to the random generator, which would randomly give you orders to shake, A & B (punch) your opponent. This is quite hard and next lesson I am going to have to look even harder into it. I I get that done, then I'm planning on doing the part where it gives you a certain amount of time to hit the enemy in the right order. The last two parts of my game that I think will be hard to develop, will be the amounts of lives (probably a variable?!?) and when you either defeat the enemy or he defeats you. At the moment, I am having difficulty handing it in, because my computer doesn’t allow me to login with gmail. I think I’ll have to use a school computer.
