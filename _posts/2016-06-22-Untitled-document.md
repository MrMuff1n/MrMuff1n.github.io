This lesson, we were looking at malware. Malware is software made for malicious intent: to take up memory and/or steal passwords so on. Different examples of malware are:

1. A Trojan

2. A Virus

3. A Worm

4. Spyware and what does it do 

5. Peripherals

6. How does Malware transfer between computers

Then, we discovered Prezi, which is a presentation maker much better than powerpoint, we had to sign in with our school accounts. Mr Keen showed us a great example about internet safety that he had prepared. He then ran through the basics so that we could do it on our own accounts, we were then allowed to muck about on it in preparation for our homework which was to be make a prezi on whatever you wanted.
