    <td>That was the first lesson of year 8 but I did have some computing skills gathered from last year.</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td>My partner and me and  made a compromise. First one of us would read out a part from the Fuze booklet and the other one would try and do what it said, if it worked first time, good, but if it didn't, both me and my partner would check through all the script and then fix any mistakes until it worked. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I do think, that I definitely need to work on my concentration in lessons, because I occasionally let my mind drift off or have a complete mind block and not remember how to code. I also think that I am a bit slow while coding, though with time and effort I can overcome this. I also think I need to get better at coding overall, but, like my speed, with time and effort I can overcome it.</td>

    <td>Next time, I will do none of of the row above, in fact, I would do the opposite. I will also bring in a memory stick as to save progress and maybe even research some of the stuff that I didn't understand properly.  </td>
